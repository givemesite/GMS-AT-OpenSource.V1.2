		## How to add phpMyAdmin 
		## Copy phpMyAdmin files to c:/work/wt-nmp/include/phpMyAdmin then uncomment:

		#location ~ ^/phpMyAdmin/.*\.php$ {
		#	root "c:/work/wt-nmp/include";
		#	try_files $uri =404;

		#}       
		#location ~ ^/phpMyAdmin/ {
		#	root "c:/work/wt-nmp/include";
		#}

		## Notice that the root directive lacks /phpMyAdmin because Nginx adds the URL path /phpMyAdmin to the root path, so the resulting directory is c:/work/wt-nmp/include/phpMyAdmin
